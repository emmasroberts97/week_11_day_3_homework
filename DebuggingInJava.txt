1. What is the purpose of a breakpoint?

It allows for you to stop at a certain line of code to see what values are.
The code will run as normal until it hits that line and then
it will pause and start the debugger console.

2. Does the line of code on a breakpoint run when you start debugging?

When it initially pauses and opens the debugger console,
no it doesn't run the line of code.

3. How do we debug the next line of code?

You can use Step Over to run the current line of code
and move to the next line of code.


4. What does the step into command do?

The step into command will go into the method that is called
on the line of code where the breakpoint is present and pause at the
top of the method.

5. What is the difference between evaluate expression
   and evaluate code fragment?

Evaluate expression lets you run your methods on
instance variables and see the result. It only lets you run one line of code.

If you want to run multiple lines of code, you would use the
evaluate code fragment.
